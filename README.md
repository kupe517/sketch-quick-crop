# Quick Crop
Quick Crop is a Sketch plugin that resizes and masks images to a shape

# How To Use
First draw a shape on the canvas where you want your image to appear. Then place the image on the canvas and select both the shape layer and image and run the Quick Crop plugin.

The plugin will automatically reposition and dynamically scale the image so that it fills the crop area either by 100% width or 100% height depending on the dimensions of the original image and shape.
